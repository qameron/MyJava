The way i have used the Memento Design pattern in my project.

Basically there are 3 main parts that have slightly different roles and they are known as the Memento, 
Caretaker and Originator.
The memento pattern is a way to 'save' the current state of the game or the project being created.
In this project, the saved state refers to the positions of the player, sheep, shepherd and wolf.

The function of this pattern within in the game is to press space to save and the R key to reload that save.

I will do this by using the originator to let the program know that it wants to save itself using the current 
variables. next, the caretaker deals with when and in what conditions these variables will be saved or restored.
lastly the memento is the holder of the temporary originator state that was saved. The memento object cannot be 
directly modified by the classes.

The caretaker asks the originator for the memento stored object and then if chosen to reload the save, 
reverts the variables collected back to those that are stored. to initiate this reload,the memento refers the 
variables back to the originator which can be directly accessed.

The originator is located in the stage class because it has direct access to the locations of the characters. it has
3 methods - set, store and restore. these methods interact with the memento class to store the variable and does not 
interact with the caretaker class. The originator is called when the player initiates a keypress corresponding to 
either space or R. variables are stored in the form of a Cell. x and y location co-ords.

In the context of my project, the caretaker class just stores the variables or articles in an arraylist in the order
they were created.

The memento class is the simplest. it literally just stores the saved article or location.

-
The memento design pattern would not be a good solution for general game saves because if the game changes state in a way 
which isn't compatible with the previous saved state then errors will arise. For example if the player wins the level and
enters into a different level with a totally different grid or interface, the previously stored coordinates will not 
be compatible with the current state of the game.
